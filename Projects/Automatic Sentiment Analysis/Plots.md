Implementation of the 3 learning algorithms, qualitatively verifying the implementations. 
In main.py, this code loads a 2D dataset from toy_data.txt, and trains your models using T=10,λ=0.2. 
main.py will compute θ and θo for each of the learning algorithms 
that you have written. Then, it will call plot_toy_data to plot the resulting model and boundary.
